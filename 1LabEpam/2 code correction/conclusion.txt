Test1.java had 2 public classes in one file.
           There were 2 "main" methods with signature "main(String[] args)", 
           so compiler couldn't decide which one to choose

Test2.java. File name (Test2.java) differs from class name(Testing2). 
            Change "Testing2"->"Test2" or "Test2.java"->"Testing2.java"

Test3.java.(String args)-> (String[] args)

Test4.java. main should be static
